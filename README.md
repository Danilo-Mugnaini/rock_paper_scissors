# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Python! This is a simple command-line game where two players can compete by choosing between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game determines the winner based on the classic rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors, with additional features like color-coded messages and scores.

## Features

- **Color-Coded Output**: 
  - **Player 1**: Green text
  - **Player 2**: Red text
  - **System Messages and Ties**: Blue text
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the scores for both players.
- **Win Condition**: The game ends when either player reaches 3 points.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors.git
   cd rock-paper-scissors
   ```

2. **Run the Game**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Instructions**:
   - Each player will be prompted to enter their choice: "R" for Rock, "P" for Paper, or "S" for Scissors.
   - The game will display the result of each round, including whether it was a win, loss, or tie, along with the updated scores.
   - The game ends when either player wins three rounds.

## Rules

- **Rock** crushes **Scissors**
